# Pong
An arcade game where two players use paddles to move a ball across the screen.

## Gameplay
- run the `main.py` file to start the game
- One player controls the `W` and `S` keys while the other controls the `Up` and `Down` keys to move the paddle
- At the start of the game, a ball will move from the center towards one side of the screen
- The goal is to use the paddle to bounce the ball to the other player's side
- If the other player does not block the ball and it falls through, a point is scored
- Currently, the game will go on indefinitely, and the only way to stop the game is to exit out of the screen
